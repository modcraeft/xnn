TODO: Implement intial, trainable AI - Logic Gates [Using Train Pipeline and xnn.h neural network model]
    OLD -- THOUGHT: Handover all memory allocation to the Train Pipeline thing and only allocate once all elements are in place.
    OLD -- THOUGHT: Therefore, need to re-define Train Pipeline to - ??? Some kind of overall controller.
